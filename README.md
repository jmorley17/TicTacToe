A game of Tic Tac Toe that can be run by command line interface.

This was the product of a project I undertook as part of a Python course on Udemy. The project itself was in Jupyter Notebooks, but I though it would be beneficial for my learning to tweak the project to be able to run as a single py file. 

The game allows the users to add their names at the start of the game, and the first play will get to pick if they would like to play X or O. From there, the game is randomized. Each iteration of the game will randomly select a player to go first. 

In order to play the game, the user's computer must have Python installed. Navigate to the folder the file in which the file is located via command prompt. Once there, type > py tictactoe.py to run the game. 

One shortfall of the game is it is built for running on Windows. Once I learn a bit more about dealing with multiple operating systems, I would like to come back and edit the program to be able to work properly on other OS's. The game does function on a Macbook, however clearing the screen after each play does not work.
